Far from perfect, this script attempts to improve on the
even less perfect scripts it is based on.

The situation since 2008 and as of the time of writing (2011) is that everyone
who uses FastCGI either uses apache or lighty's prefork managers, or
language-specific builtins (ref: php-fcgi or php-fpm), however there are no good
cgi-bin wrappers. People write their own and they all usually suck.

nginx-fcgi2.pl: well-hacked version based on FCGI::Request
    employs "ordered I/O" to avoid deadlocks
    contains pidfile and daemon support
cgiwrap.pl:     fugly baroque version based on FCGI::ProcManager
    employs pipe open and is rather unsatisfactory

For best effect wrap these scripts into daemontools in case they suck so bad they die.

futher work based needed working stdin/stdout
TODO: proper PIDfile logic. cleanup. rc script. logfile rotation. use strict

To remove the suckage, what we need is a novel approach implemented in a language
that doesnt have sucky threads.

We need to look at SAPI/WSAPI/KAPI and WSGI too.
